			<h2>Cascading Order</h2>
			What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

				All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

			<ul>
				<li>Inline style (inside an HTML element)</li>
				<li>External and internal style sheets (in the head section)</li>
				<li>Browser default</li>
			</ul>
				So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

					<h1>Check if Git has already been installed
					Git is usually preinstalled on Mac and Linux.</h1>

					Type the following command and then press enter:

					git --version

					You should receive a message that tells you which Git version you have on your computer. If you don’t receive a “Git version” message, it means that you need to download Git.

					If Git doesn’t automatically download, there’s an option on the website to download manually. Then follow the steps on the installation window.

					After you are finished installing Git, open a new shell and type git --version again to verify that it was correctly installed.
